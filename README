1. Introduction
---------------

This folder contains various extremly useful generic VHDL compoments.
Documentation for each component can be found in the following sections.
If you add a component, you have to conform to the existing coding conventions
and you have to append a section to this document. If you fail to do so, your
component will be deleted without further notice.
